PROBLEM STATEMENT:-

  Project Overview:
Develop a Java Notes Manager that allows users to create, update, and analyze text-based notes efficiently. This application will enable users to:

Create a new Java note “JavaFile1.txt” (enter the given text from the console and save it to this file)

Java is an object-oriented programming language.
It supports encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.
File handling in Java allows for efficient reading and searching of text.
Keep learning and mastering Java!

Display the existing Java note (read and display file content on the console).
Create another Java note “JavaFile2.txt” and (enter the given text from the console and save it to this file)
This is the first line in this JavaFile2.txt file.
Read the content of Java note “JavaFile1.txt” and copy it to “JavaFile2.txt” using file steams. (Keep the previous text intact and add it from the next line)
Analyze the “JavaFile1.txt” note, providing:
Total number of characters?
Total number of lines?
Total number of words?
Search for the word “polymorphism” in “JavaFile1.txt” and print the line number where it appears and also find the total occurrences of this word in this file.
Hint:
Read each line using ‘fileobj.readLine()’ until ‘null’.
Check if ‘line.contains(wordToFind)’.
Increment a counter to track the line number when found.
